# Nut_Job
Squirrel tracker


We started by making a views file that would execute what we were trying to do. We edited the models to format the database, and both urls files (one under the inner oursite, one under Squirrel_Life) to link the functionalites to the user interface.
In the views file we tried to create all four views: display sightings, add sightings, and edit them.
In our case, the application doesn't run smoothly: Unfortunately, we lacked time and visbility to find and correct our errors, especially since we aren't used to this style and type of coding, where we can't immediately test our work. However, we did do our best.
